[Akan Name Generator Link](https://njoki254.github.io/Birthday-Project/)

## Overall Description
The goal of this project was to practice and better understand  working with data types, Array, writing functions, control flow, and operators.

This is a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.

Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names.

## Algorithms USED

Zellar Algorithims

Day of the week (d) = ( ( (CC/4) -2*CC-1) + ((5*YY/4) ) + ((26*(MM+1)/10)) + DD ) mod 7

 where;

 CC - is the century digits. For example 1989 has CC = 19

 YY - is the Year digits (1989 has YY = 89)

 MM -  is the Month

 DD - is the Day of the month

 mod - is the modulus function ( % )
BDD
